# Jekyll Doc Theme with bootstrap v4.0
*note this is a work in progress*

## Goal

To have a jekyll theme that is built with bootstrap v4.0.
Since I can not find one and then share it with everyone else.

## Running locally

You need Ruby and gem before starting, then:

```bash
# install bundler
gem install bundler

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme.git
cd jekyll-doc-theme

# run jekyll with dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## License

Released under [the MIT license](LICENSE).

### Original 

While I build my version with bootstrap v4.0 
if you cannot wait and you cannot find it anywhere here is a jekyll-doc-theme with 3.3.7


Go to [the website](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/) for detailed information and demo.
