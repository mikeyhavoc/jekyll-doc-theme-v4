# Drafts

Area for posts you have not finished.
or are working on yet have not finished.

## Other Ideas

Maybe You do not want them posted just yet so you might put your posts here and then change their dates, or doc files here to later add to the doc section. many reasons to place in here.

## notes

If you do use this section make sure to delete it once you merge your gh-pages if you do not want it visible on that side. otherwise just leave it alone. othere wise merge then delete then add all commit then push gh-pages. then you have your master branch with your branch with your drafts and your gh-pages side without.
